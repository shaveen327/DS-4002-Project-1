"Notes"
"Data are reported for each calendar month. Monthly enrollment data may be updated in subsequent CMS Eligibility and Enrollment Reports. For data from June 2017 to present, several states have revised their methodology to better align with CMS Eligibility and Enrollment Reports criteria; data reported for May 2017 and earlier months were not updated to reflect this change in methodology and may not be comparable to enrollment from June 2017 forward. "
""
"The total increase in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment between the Pre-ACA Average Monthly Medicaid/CHIP Enrollment and each month reported post-ACA implementation include data only from states reporting for both periods."

"CMS, Medicaid & CHIP Monthly Applications, Eligibility Determinations, and Enrollment Reports: January 2014 - August 2024 (preliminary), as of November 27, 2024. Monthly CMS Medicaid & CHIP Enrollment Reports for all periods are available from CMS [here](http://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/medicaid-and-chip-application-eligibility-determination-and-enrollment-data.html)."

"Definitions"
"*Pre-ACA Average Monthly Medicaid/CHIP Enrollment:* The average number of individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP for each month during the July-September, 2013 period using an average of enrollment numbers submitted by the states for each month in this period. Not all states submitted three months of data; the average is calculated using any months of baseline data that were provided. The unit of measurement is individuals enrolled as of the last day of the reporting period (month)."
""
"*Post-ACA Medicaid/CHIP Monthly Enrollment:* The total unduplicated number of individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP as of the last day of each reporting period, including those with retroactive, conditional, and presumptive eligibility. This indicator is a point-in-time count of total program enrollment and is not solely a count of those newly enrolled during the reporting period. This number includes only those individuals who are eligible for comprehensive benefits (e.g., emergency Medicaid, family planning-only coverage and limited benefit dual eligible individuals are excluded). Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration populations are included as long as the benefits and networks are comprehensive. CHIP children subject to a waiting period or premium lock-out period are considered eligible but not enrolled and are not included. Data are subject to change based on subsequent CMS enrollment reports. Other reporting on Medicaid and CHIP enrollment by states and researchers may include some beneficiaries excluded in these data (because comprehensive coverage is not provided), or may use a different methodology."
""
"*Percent Change:* The percentage change in total post-ACA Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, from the pre-ACA average monthly Medicaid and CHIP Enrollment (July-Sept 2013) to each monthly enrollment total reported (as described above). Percent change is calculated for each month as compared to the baseline data. Changes in enrollment levels are driven by the number of newly enrolled individuals as well as by the number of individuals whose coverage has terminated."
